		<h2>Pygame</h2>
		<h3>TRON</h3>
		<p>A recreation of the old arcade game, TRON was my first 
		large project through pygame. The game features both a one
		player and two player mode. I created an AI (a generous title)
		for the computer player in the one player mode. It works
		by detecting it's relative distance to the walls and each of
		the player's lines, thereby avoiding each of them and staying
		alive for as long as possible. Besides the code, I also spent
		a considerable amount of time on the visuals and theme, which
		overall made the game much more appealing.</p>
		
		<h3>BattleShip</h3>
