		<h1>General Python</h1>
		<h3>Web Scraper</h3>
		<p>As a part of my IB Computer Science Course, I built my own 
		webscraper that could detect changes on a webpage. Instead of
		focusing on one website for my Web Scraper to work on, I tried
		to make it as general as possible so that it could function on
		any page. The scraper does this through two steps. First, it takes
		the ENTIRETY of the particular websites's HTML and converts it
		into a single string. From there, it counts the characters to see
		if the website's structure itself had changed. Secondly, it goes
		and finds the first paragraph tag within the website and analyzes
		any changes to that. A later update to the program also incorporated
		the "Twilio" module to send a mobile message to the user's phone
		when a change is detected. Overall, it was a fairly simple program
		with a lot of room for improvement but in its current state it did
		its job and I'm overall pretty proud of it.</p>

		<h1>Pygame</h1>
		<h3>TRON</h3>
		<p>A recreation of the old arcade game, TRON was my first 
		large project through pygame. The game features both a one
		player and two player mode. I created an AI (a generous title)
		for the computer player in the one player mode. It works
		by detecting it's relative distance to the walls and each of
		the player's lines, thereby avoiding each of them and staying
		alive for as long as possible. Besides the code, I also spent
		a considerable amount of time on the visuals and theme, which
		overall made the game much more appealing.</p>

		<h3>BattleShip</h3>
		<p>Based completely on the board game, Battleship is a one or
		two player game where each side is trying to sink all of each
		other's ships. I built another AI for this game and unlike the
		TRON AI, this one functioned with strategy. Upon finding a ship,
		 my AI would focus in on that general location on the map and
		 sink that specific ship. The game has multiple windows including
		 a title page, a help page, a setup page where each player can
		 place their ships, and the actual game page. The game also has
		 added themes that the player can choose from.</p>

		<h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
		<p>A misleading title, Conway's Game of Life is a mathematic/biological
		simulation reflecting the growth and death of populations. On a grid
		system, each individual grid is an organism whose sustained life or
		immediate death is based on its number of neighbors. Along with creating
		my own custom algorithm for this simulation, I also added a bunch of preset
		patterns that I can "spawn" on the grid, many of which are shown below.</p>

		<h3>Ideal Gas Law Simulation</h3>
		<p>This is a project I did for my Computer Science IA where I built a 
		simulation visualizing the ideal gas law for a physics teacher at my
		school. The program allows its users to choose two variables to 
		manipulate and then shows the relationship between those two variables.</p>
